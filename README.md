Puzzle game. Play it at http://games.adanferguson.com.

This is a game I've been working on since the first version from Ludum Dare 26 in 2013. This is the 4th "edition", where I decided to make the levels more strategic and less "spamming things all over the place".

It's all html/js/css, literally no plugins at all. This is not really a good thing, it's made it sort of a headache for a few reason.
